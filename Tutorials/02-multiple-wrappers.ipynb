    "# Tutorial 02: Multiple wrappers\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the use of multiple data sources, and shows how can one exchange information between them interchangeably. The code given here is based on this [1] example and builds upon on the gentle introdcution on the CUDS API [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "One of the main strengths of CUDS objects is their ability to share information between different underlying data sources interchangeably. Using osp-core's innerworkings a data source can be represented as a CUDS object. A data source can be in turn a database, a simulation engine, or any other software package, which is able to either generate or store information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to a CUDS object, which represents an underlying data source as a **wrapper**, as it wraps around the data source. Wrappers use the CUDS API with the addition to some wrapper-specific methods, which will be discussed later on in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a wrapper to be initialized, one needs some context for the underlying data source (e.g. location, credentials, etc.) for this we introduce an object called **session**. Conceptually a session can be thought as an interoperability level, or in simple terms it handles the transition from the user-friendly CUDS API to the more task-specific syntax data sources tend to have."

In our case it will find its new citizen **Peter** and it will add it to the **EMMO town** in the database instance of the town, `db_emmo_town`.
